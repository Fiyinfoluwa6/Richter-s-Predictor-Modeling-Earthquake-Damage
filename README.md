## Project Summary
The Capstone project was carried out with the support of the competition made available by [Driven Data](https://https://www.drivendata.org/).  Following the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal a survey was carried out by  [Living Labs](http://www.kathmandulivinglabs.org/) and the [Central Bureau of Statistics](https://cbs.gov.np/), the survey is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics.

 * Business Case
 
Predicting Earthquake damage grade level has been a much needed and important research area, where the later instances of the destructive damage can be speculated. Following the effect of an earthquake, monitoring and detecting  the damage caused on the buildings is still a difficult task, as there involves many buildings that are affected. As a result it is important to have infomations about the building prior to when the earth quake occurs so that we can be able to determine the building that will be affeacted 

 * Goal
 
Based on aspects of building location and construction, the goal is to analyze predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal
## Motivation
The project was carried out ot help investigators effectively manage, monitor and detect the damage caused on the buildings following the effect of an earthquake
